# HW1-Code-Refactor

## The objective of this project is to gain experience in refactoring existing code to make the webpage more accessible. Accessibility includes replacing non-descriptive div containers with semantic elements to describe functional areas of the site as well as adding --- tags to all images. Rulesets are also consolidated to remove redunancies.
