# HW1-Code-Refactor

## The objective of this project was to gain experience in refactoring existing HTML and CSS code to make a webpage more accessible. Adding accessibility included replacing non-descriptive div containers with semantic elements to describe functional areas of the site as well as adding descriptive alt text to all images. Rulesets were also consolidated to remove redunancies. Refactoring code to add accessibility is valuable for any company to reach a larger audience and to avoid any complaints or lawsuits. Refactoring the code to be more efficent is good practice and can prevent bugs and complications down the line. Both of these skills are valuable in the real world and are thus valuable to me as a prospective developer. I learned how to look at existing code and consolidate it without removing function and I gained practice with syntax of both HTML and CSS.
